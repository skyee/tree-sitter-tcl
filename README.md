# tree-sitter-tcl

Tree-sitter grammar for Tcl language.


## Credits

Handling of word concatenation was inspired by [tree-sitter-bash]. I didn't
think of using external scanner to do that.

The code allowing to develop two grammars in one repository was basically copied
from [tree-sitter-typescript].
